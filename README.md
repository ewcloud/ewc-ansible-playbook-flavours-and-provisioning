# Flavours and Provisioning
>ðŸ’¡ Two categories of templates in this collection, 1) one to configure previously provisioned instances, and 2) another to self-provisioning or manage provisioned instances (i.e. "one-line" deployment and full state management).

A collection of configuration templates
(i.e. [Ansible Playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html))
to customize your environment in the
[European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/). See full list of Items in the [index](#index) below.
