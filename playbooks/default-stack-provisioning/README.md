# Default Stack Provisioning
>‚úÖ This template can be safely applied from any local work environment, even running outside an EWC tenancy's private network.

The default stack provides an integrated environment for secure access and centralized management in the [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/). It orchestrates the deployment of an IPA server for LDAP and DNS functionality, an SSH bastion for access from the public internet, and a remote desktop for graphical interfacing, while ensuring both the bastion and desktop are enrolled as clients to the IPA server to centralize authentication, authorization, and resource discovery.

This configuration template (i.e., an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html)) builds upon the individual templates for [IPA server](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-server-provisioning), [SSH bastion](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ssh-bastion-provisioning), [remote desktop](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/remote-desktop-provisioning), and [IPA client](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-client-enroll-flavour) to automate their deployment and integration.

## Functionality
The template is designed to:

* Provision the IPA server instance via Terraform, including network validation and automatic subnet DNS updates to enable centralized user management and resource discovery across the environment.
* Provision the SSH bastion instance via Terraform, configured as a secure entrypoint with intrusion prevention.
* Enroll the newly provisioned SSH bastion as an IPA client, connecting it to the IPA server for centralized credentials and DNS resolution.
* Provision the remote desktop instance via Terraform, equipped for graphical access over varying bandwidths.
* Enroll the newly provisioned remote desktop as an IPA client, integrating it with the IPA server for unified access control.

After successful provisioning, you can leverage Terraform's functionality to modify or delete individual components safely. Each will have its own `main.tf` definition and `terraform.tfstate` state file under the corresponding user-defined local directories.

To learn the basics about managing infrastructure with Terraform, check out [Terraform in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/tomUWcQ0P3k?si=CJwZJ7UaqpynDU-d) on YouTube. You can also find a step-by-step example applied to the EWC on the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/2EDOIQ).

>‚ö†Ô∏è Successful execution leads to changes of the DNS nameserver(s) in your
OpenStack subnet (includes now only the IP address of the new IPA server).
This can negatively affect existing VMs within your subnet.
To prevent issues, programmatically update each VM via the
[IPA Client Enroll Flavour](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-client-enroll-flavour)
CommunityHub Item. Alternatively, you can manually
[add the new nameserver](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/identity_management_guide/domain-dns)
to their DNS configuration.

## Prerequisites

## Usage

![Template Edition and Running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning/refs/heads/main/playbooks/default-stack-provisioning/docs/images/item-edit-run.webp)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning.git
```

#### 1.1. Change to the specific Item's subdirectory

```bash
cd ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning/playbooks/default-stack-provisioning
```

#### 1.2. (Optional) Checkout an specific Item's version
>‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to replace `x.y.z` in the command below, with your version of preference.

```bash
git checkout x.y.z
```

### 2. Download  Ansible dependencies
>üí° By default, Ansible Roles are installed under the `~/.ansible/roles` directory within your working environment.

Download the correct version of the Ansible dependencies, if you haven't done so already:

```
ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml
```

### 3. Configure and apply the template

This template can be used interactively or non-interactively (i.e. with one single command to configure and also execute).
Please beware that, regardless of your mode of choice, the complete execution may take several minutes, up to an hour.

#### 3.1. Interactive Mode

By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
target EWC environment:

```bash
ansible-playbook default-stack-provisioning.yml
```

#### 3.2. Non-Interactive Mode
>üí° To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
[official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
`--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For example:

```bash
ansible-playbook \
  -e '{
