# SSH bastion provisioning
>✅ This template can be safely applied from any local work environment, even running outside an EWC tenancy's private network.

The [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) proxy or bastion server
is a barrier between your internal machines (without public or floating IPs)
and the public internet. With the SSH proxy, you'll have an extra layer of
security on top of your instances. It's equipped with
[Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban),
intrusion prevention software designed to prevent brute-force attacks.

This is a configuration template
(i.e. an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html))
to customize your environment in the
[European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).

## Functionality

The template is designed to:

* Provision an instance via [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform),
with your specified Linux distribution and desired flavor (a.k.a VM plan):
  * If a `terraform.tfstate` [state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state)
  is not found under the user-defined directory, attempts to create the
  instance from scratch

    OR
  * If  `terraform.tfstate` file is found, leverages Terraform's out-of-the-box functionality to update the instance referenced on it
* Configure the existing or newly provisioned RockyLinux virtual machines (with
public IP address), as entrypoint for users who wish to reach private EWC networks
 from the public internet via SSH.

After successful provisioning, you can leverage Terraform's functionality to modify or delete individual components safely. Each will have its own `main.tf` definition and `terraform.tfstate` state file under the corresponding user-defined local directories.

To learn the basics about managing infrastructure with Terraform, check out [Terraform in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/tomUWcQ0P3k?si=CJwZJ7UaqpynDU-d) on YouTube. You can also find a step-by-step example applied to the EWC on the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/2EDOIQ).

## Prerequisites

* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.0 or higher )
* Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (version 3.9 or higher) 
* Install [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible) (version 2.15 or higher)
* Install [terraform](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+IaC+via+Terraform+and+OpenTofu#EWCIaCviaTerraformandOpenTofu-InstallationoftheCLI) (version 1.0 or higher)
* Get OpenStack API credentials (see [How to request OpenStack Application Credentials](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+request+Openstack+Application+Credentials) section of the EWC documentation)
* Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating Keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
* Import your public SSH key to OpenStack (see [Import SSH Key](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+OpenStack+Command-Line+client#EWCOpenStackCommandLineclient-ImportSSHkey) section of the EWC documentation).

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning.git
```

#### 1.1. Change to the specific Item's subdirectory

```bash
cd ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning/playbooks/ssh-bastion-provisioning
```

#### 1.2. (Optional) Checkout an specific Item's version
>⚠️ Make sure to replace `x.y.z` in the command below, with your version of preference.

```bash
git checkout x.y.z
```

### 2. Download  Ansible dependencies
>💡 By default, Ansible Roles are installed under the `~/.ansible/roles` directory within your working environment.

Download the correct version of the Ansible dependencies, if you haven't done so already:

```
ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml
```

### 3. Configure and apply the template

#### 3.1. Interactive Mode

By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
target EWC environment:

```bash
ansible-playbook ssh-bastion-provisioning.yml
```

#### 3.2. Non-Interactive Mode

>💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
[official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
`--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For example:

```bash
ansible-playbook \
  -e '{
        "ewc_provider":"eumetsat",
        "ssh_bastion_tf_project_path":"~/ewc/ssh-bastion-1",
        "ssh_bastion_app_name":"ssh",
        "ssh_bastion_instance_name":"bastion",
        "ssh_bastion_instance_index":1,
        "ssh_bastion_flavor_name":"eo1.large",
        "ssh_bastion_image_name":"Rocky-9.5-20250604142417",
        "public_keypair_name":"my-public-key-name",
        "private_keypair_path":"~/.ssh/id_rsa",
        "private_network_name":"private",
        "security_group_name":"ssh",
        "fail2ban_whitelisted_ip_ranges":""
    }' \
  ssh-bastion-provisioning.yml
```
